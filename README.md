# garage_vagrant_libvirt_ansible

This Vagrant setup creates a VM and sets up the
[Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) S3-compatible storage solution on it.

Default OS is openSUSE Leap 15.6. Although that can be changed in the
Vagrantfile, please beware that this will break the Ansible provisioning.

## Vagrant

1. You need vagrant obviously. And ansible. And git...
1. Fetch the box, per default this is `opensuse/Leap-15.6.x86_64`, using
   `vagrant box add opensuse/Leap-15.6.x86_64`.
1. Make sure the git submodules are fully working by issuing `git submodule init
   && git submodule update`
1. Run `vagrant up`
1. Party!

## Cleaning up

The VMs can be torn down after playing around using `vagrant destroy`.
